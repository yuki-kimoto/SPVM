=head1 Name

SPVM::ExchangeAPI - SPVM Exchange API

=head1 Description

C<SPVM::ExchangeAPI> is APIs to convert Perl data structures to/from SPVM data structures, and to call SPVM methods from Perl.

=head1 Usage
  
  use SPVM ();
  my $api = SPVM::api();
  my $spvm_int_array = $api->new_int_array([1, 2, 3]);
  my $perl_array_ref = $spvm_int_array->to_array;
  
  my $spvm_string = $api->new_string("abc");
  my $perl_string = $spvm_string->to_string;
  
  use SPVM 'Int';
  my $int_object = Int->new(4);
  my $value = $int_object->value;

=head1 Fields

=head2 env

  my $env = $api->env;

Gets the current execution environment.

=head2 stack

  my $stack = $api->stack;

Gets the current call stack.

=head1 Class Methods

  my $api = SPVM::ExchangeAPI->new(env => $env, stack => $stack);

Creates a new L<SPVM::ExchangeAPI> object.

Options:

=over 2

=item C<env>

An execution environment.

C<env> must be a L<SPVM::Bulder::Env> or L<SPVM::BlessedObject::Class> object of the L<Native::Env|SPVM::Native::Env> class.
  
=item C<stack>

If $string is undef, returns undef.

If $string is a L<SPVM::BlessedObject::String> object, returns itself.

Exceptions:

$string must be a non-reference scalar or a SPVM::BlessedObject::String object or undef. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

Examples:
