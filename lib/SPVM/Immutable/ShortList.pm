  # Create a short list with array length
  my $list = Immutable::ShortList->new_len(10);
  
  # Get list length
  my $length = $list->length;
  
  # Get value.

This field is the length of the elements of the list.

=head1 Class Methods

=head2 new

  static method new : Immutable::ShortList ($array : short[] = undef);

Create a new L<Immutable::ShortList|SPVM::Immutable::ShortList> object using L</"new_len">.

The passed length to L</"new_len"> is the length of the array. If the array is undef, the length is 0.

The elements of the array are copied to the elements of the the created array.

  method get : int ($index : int);

Gets the element of the position of the $index.

Exceptions:
