=head1 Name

SPVM::Runtime - Runtime

=head1 Description

C<SPVM::Runtime> is the C<Runtime> class in the L<SPVM> language. 

The instance has the runtime information such as operation codes, classes, methods, fields, class variables, constant strings.

This class provides only the minimal methods to get the information of classes and methods.

An instance of the C<Runtime> class is build by the L<build_runtime|SPVM::Compiler/"build_runtime"> method in the L<Compiler|SPVM::Compiler> class.

A execution environemt is build by the L<build_env|/"build_env"> method in this class.

=head1 Usage

  use Runtime;
  
  my $runtime = $compiler->build_runtime;
  
  my $class_names = $runtime->get_class_names;
  
  my $method_names = $runtime->get_method_names("Foo");
  
  my $env = $runtime->build_env;
  
  my $stack = $env->build_stack;

=head1 Pointer

The C<Runtime> class is a L<pointer class|SPVM::Document::Language/"Pointer Class">.

Its insntace has a pointer to a L<runtime|SPVM::Document::NativeAPI::Runtime> object.
