=head2 tr

  static method tr : string ($string : string, $pattern : string, $replace : string)

Replaced the range of $pattern with the range of $replace in a $string and returns a replaced string.

The range must be the format C<a-z> or C<a>. If the format is C<a>, it is converted to C<a-a>.

  # The range format examples
  "a-z"

The $pattern must be defined. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The $replace must be defined. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

If the $string contains an invalid Unicode code point, an exception is thrown.

The range format of the (pattern|replace) cannnot be contain an invalid Unicode code point. If so, an exception is thrown. If so, an exception is thrown.

The second character ot the range format of the (pattern|replace) must be \"-\". Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The range format of the (pattern|replace) must be 1 or 3 characters. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The exceptions of the L<"/get_code_point"> method can be thrown.

C<Examples:>

  {
    my $string = "０１２３４５６７８９";
    my $pattern = "０-９";
    my $replace = "0-9";
    
    # "0123456789"

=head2 utf8_substr

  static method utf8_substr : string ($string : string, $utf8_offset : int, $utf8_length : int = -1);

Gets the substring from the $string. The extracting range of the string is from the $utf8_offset to the position proceeded by the $utf8_length, and returns it.

If the length is less than 0, the length to the end of the string is calculated from the length of the $string and the $utf8_offset.

Exceptions:

The $string must be defined. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

If the $string contains an invalid Unicode code point, an exception is thrown.

The $utf8_offset + the $utf8_length must be less than or equal to the UTF-8 length of the $string. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

Examples:

  # "いえ"
  my $utf8_substr = Fn->utf8_substr("あいうえ", 1, 2);

=head2 merge_options

  static method merge_options : object[] ($options1 : object[], $options2 : object[]);

Creates a new any object array merging the $options1 and the $options2, and returns it.

If the $options2 contains the same key of the $options1, the key of the $options1 is overwritten by the key of $options2.

Exceptions:

The $options1 must be defined. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The $options2 must be defined. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The length of the $options1 must be an even number. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The length of the $options2 must be an even number. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The key of the $options1 must be defined. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The key of the $options1 must be the string type. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The key of the $options2 must be defined. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The key of the $options2 must be the string type. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

Exceptions of the L<Hash|SPVM::Hash> class can be thrown.

Examples:

  my $merged_options = Fn->merge_options({foo => 1, bar => 2}, {baz => 5});
