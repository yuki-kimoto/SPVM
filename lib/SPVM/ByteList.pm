SPVM::ByteList - Dynamic byte Array

=head1 Usage
  
  use ByteList;
  
  # Create a byte list
  my $list = ByteList->new;
  my $list = ByteList->new([(byte)1, 2, 3]);
  
  # Create a byte list with array length
  my $list = ByteList->new_len(10);
  
  # Get list length
  my $length = $list->length;
  
  # Push value
  $list->push(3);
  
  # Pop value.
  my $element = $list->pop;
  
  # Unshift value.
  $list->unshift(3);
  
  # Shift value.
  my $element = $list->shift;
  
  # Set value.
  $list->set(2, 3);
  
  # Get value.
  my $element = $list->get(2);
  
  # Insert value
  $list->insert(1, 3);
  
  # Remove value
  my $element = $list->remove(1);
  
  # Convert list to array.
  my $array = $list->to_array;
  
=head1 Description

C<ByteList> is a dynamic C<byte> array.

=head1 Enumerations

  enum {
    DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 4,
  }

=head2 DEFAULT_CAPACITY

The default capacity. The value is 4.

=head1 Fields

=head2 capacity

  has capacity : ro int;

The capacity. This is the length of the internally reserved elements to extend the length of the list.

=head2 length

  has length : ro int;

The length of the list.

=head1 Class Methods

=head2 new

  static method new : ByteList ($array : byte[] = undef, $capacity : int = -1);

Creates a new C<ByteList> object using L</"new_len">.

The passed length to L</"new_len"> is the length of the $array. If the array is undef, the length is 0.

The elements of the $array are copied to the elements of the the created array.

Examples:

  my $list = ByteList->new;
  my $list = ByteList->new([(byte)1, 2, 3]);

=head2 new_len

  static method new_len : ByteList ($length : int, $capacity : int = -1);

Creates a new C<ByteList> object with the $length and the $capacity.

If the $capacity is less than 0, the capacity is set to the value of L</"DEFAULT_CAPACITY">.

If the $length is greater than the $capacity, the $capacity is set to the $length.

Exceptions:

The $length must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head1 Instance Methods

=head2 get

  method get : int ($index : int);

Gets the element of the position of the $index.

Exceptions:

The $index must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The $index must be less than the length of the $list. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 insert

  method insert : void ($index : int, $element : int);

Inserts an $element to the position of the $index.

Exceptions:

The $index must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The $index must be less than or equal to the length of the $list. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 pop

  method pop : int ();

Removes the last element and return it.

Exceptions:

The length of the $list must be greater than 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 push
  
  method push : void ($element : int);

Adds an $element after the end of the list.

=head2 remove

  method remove : int ($index : int);

Removes the element at the position of the $index and return it.

Exceptions:

The $index must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The $index must be less than the length of the $list. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 replace

  method replace : void ($offset : int, $remove_length : int, $replace : byte[]);

Replaces the elements of the range specified by the $offset and the $lenght with the $replace array.

Exceptions:

The $offset must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The $remove_length must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The $offset + the $removing lenght must be less than or equal to the length of the $list. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 reserve

  method reserve : void ($new_capacity : int);

Reserves the elements with the $new_capacity.

If the $new_capacity is greater than the capacity of the list, the capacity of the list is extended to the $new_capacity.

Exceptions:

The $new_capacity must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 resize

  method resize : void ($new_length : int);

Resizes the list with the $new_length.

Exceptions:

The $new_length must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 set

  method set : void ($index : int, $element : int);

Sets the $element at the position of the $index.

Exceptions:

The $index must be greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The $index must be less than the length of the $list.

=head2 set_array

  method set_array : void ($array : byte[]);

Sets an $array. Each element of the $array is copied to the element of the list.

Exceptions:

The $array must be defined. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

The length of the $array must be the $same as the length of the $list.

=head2 shift

  method shift : int ();

Removes the first element and return it.

Exceptions:

The length of the $list must be greater than 0. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 to_array

  method to_array : byte[] ();

Creates a new array with the length of the list and copies all elements of the list into the new array, and returns it.

=head2 get_array_unsafe

  method get_array_unsafe : byte[] ();

Gets the internally array.

This array is unsafe because it continues to point to the old array if the internal array is extended.

=head2 unshift

  method unshift : void ($element : int);

Inserts an $element at the beginning of the list.
