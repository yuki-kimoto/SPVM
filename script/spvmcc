=head1 Details

=head2 spvmcc Command

  spvmcc [OPTIONS] SCRIPT_NAME

The C<spvmcc> command generates an executable file from SPVM classes.

I<OPTIONS> are L<options|/"Options">.

I<SCRIPT_NAME> is a script path that contains an SPVM script.
  
  # myapp.spvm
  use Fn;
  my $var = 1;
  say $var;

Anon class that contains a L<bootstrap method|SPVM::Document::Language::Class/"Bootstrap Method"> is allowed as an SPVM script.

  # myapp.spvm
  class {
    
    version "1.001";
    
    our $FOO : int;
    
    use Fn;
    
    static method main : void () {
      my $var = 1;
      say $var;
    }
  }

The base name of I<SCRIPT_NAME> must be a L<Script Base Name|spvm/"Script Base Name">. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

See L<Class Search Directories|SPVM::Document::Language::Class/"Class Search Directories"> about default class search directories.

See L<SPVM::Document::EnvironmentVariables> about available environment variables.

=head2 Config File for Executable File

A config file that corresponding to the script name must exist for an executable file except for the case that L<"--no-config"> is specified.

The config for an executable file is a L<SPVM::Builder::Config::Exe> object.

C<myapp.config>:

  use SPVM::Builder::Config::Exe;
  
  my $exe_config = SPVM::Builder::Config::Exe->new;
  
  $exe_config

=head2 Caching System

Compiled object files and an executable file are not rebuilt unless they need to be rebuilt.

L</"--force"> option forces the rebuild.

=head2 Resources

There are important points to be aware of when generating executable files. That is, L<resources|SPVM::Document::Resource> are not automatically compiled.

When you run an SPVM program with the L<spvm> command, the resources are contained within the shared library of each class. Therefore, there are no conflicts between resources.

However, in the case of executable files, there are resource conflicts. For this, the resources must be resolved manually in the configuration file.

  $config->use_resource('Resource::Zlib');

This is hard work, but given that the executable file must be compiled from source files and run on a variety of platforms, I think that solving it manually is a better way.

I have published a command that allows you to view the list of classes using resources and the resource settings.

See also L<--resource-info|spvmdeps/"--resource-info"> option in L<spvmdeps> command to dump resource information.

=head2 lib Directive

If the source code specified by I<SCRIPT_NAME> contains lib directives, The directories specified by lib directive is prepeneded to L<class search directories|SPVM::Document::Language::Class/"Class Search Directories">.
  
  #lib "$FindBin::Bin/lib"

This directories specified by lib directive is placed after the directories specified by L</"--include-dir"> option.

=head2 SPVM Archive

An SPVM archive is a tarball (C<.tar.gz>) containing SPVM class files and object files generated from native classes, precompilation classes, and resource classes.

C<spvmcc.json> in an SPVM archive has archive information. This contains the application name, the mode, the version and class information.

The recommended file extension is C<.spvm-archive.tar.gz>.

An SPVM archive does not contains external object files(C<.o>), static library files(C<.a>), dynamic library files(C<.so>, C<.dll>, etc), and SPVM anon class files.

An SPVM archive can be created by C<--build-spvm-archive> option.

  spvmcc --build-spvm-archive -o $exe_dir/myapp.spvm-archive.tar.gz myapp.spvm

An SPVM archive can be load by L<SPVM::Builder::Config::Exe/"load_spvm_archive"> method.

By loading an SPVM archive, you can load its classes, and its object files are linked.

If an SPVM archive is loaded and C<--build-spvm-archive> option is specified, the current application information is merged with the SPVM archive information, and then the merged SPVM archive is output.
